# AutoInventory

This program is designed for use by people at my company.

The program starts with an excel sheet that contains consumable inventory information. 
It will navigate through SAP using PyAutoGUI to compile inventory information listed in the system.
It then compares the SAP inventory to the excel inventory and tells the operator which components need to be consumed or if a different team needs to be contacted.
